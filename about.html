    <h1>About Us.</h1>
    <h3>Est. 2021</h3>
    <p>We are two college kids who decided to start a clothing brand 
        to make streetwear fashion avalible to everyone. All of our
        pieces are made with sustainable materials making good fashion affordable 
    </p>

    <p>This project is also our first website we have built. We are Computer
        Science students with a desire to make ourselves stand out from the crowd - 
        <strong>not only with our fashion </strong>- but with our software development as well.
